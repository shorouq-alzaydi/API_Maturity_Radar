{"Assessment Date": "2025-10-24", "Maturity Level": "Level 1", "Final Maturity Level": "Level 1: Resource-Oriented", "Analysis Summary": "The API achieves a maturity level of 1: Resource-Oriented because it represents distinct resources, uses nouns instead of verbs in URLs, and demonstrates basic use of HTTP methods. However, it lacks versioning in the base path, which is a requirement for Level 2. Additionally, while the API uses correct HTTP verbs and status codes, it does not fully comply with all validation rules, such as including a standardized error schema and versioning. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for higher maturity levels.", "Governance Compliance": {"Total Rules Checked": 5, "Total Violations Found": 2, "Violations List": [{"Rules Violated": "Rule 1.2: Versioning", "Reason & Location": "The base path does not include a version segment (e.g., /v1/)."}, {"Rules Violated": "Rule 1.5: Error Schema", "Reason & Location": "Error responses do not include the required schema with code, message, and timestamp."}]}}
