# API Validation Rules

## Rule 1.1: Resource Naming
- All resource names **must** be plural nouns (e.g., `/users`, `/orders`).
- Names should use lowercase and hyphens (`-`) instead of underscores.

## Rule 1.2: Versioning
- The API **must** include a version segment in the base path (e.g., `/v1/`).

## Rule 1.3: HTTP Methods
- Each operation must use the correct HTTP verb.
  - `GET` for retrieval, `POST` for creation, `PUT` for full update, `PATCH` for partial update, `DELETE` for removal.

## Rule 1.4: Standardized Response Codes
- Use standard HTTP response codes consistently:
  - 200 for success, 201 for creation, 400 for bad request, 404 for not found, 500 for server error.

## Rule 1.5: Error Schema
- Error responses should include:
  - `code` (string)
  - `message` (string)
  - `timestamp` (ISO 8601)
